Joffrey Baratheon: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.
Tyrion Lannister: That would make me the "Quarter Man"; just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except my head would be up there too! I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
Tyrion Lannister: Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?
Sandor Clegane: Eat shit, Dwarf.
Tyrion Lannister: You're on the wrong side of the wall!
Sandor Clegane: I lost half of my men. The Blackwater's on fire.
Joffrey Baratheon: Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!
Tyrion Lannister: You're Kingsguard, Clegane. We must beat them back, or they're going to take this city! Your King's city!
Sandor Clegane: Fuck the Kingsguard! Fuck the city! Fuck the King!
Tyrion Lannister: Men, form up! Men! Men! They say I'm half a man, but what does that make the lot of you?
Lannister Soldier: The only way out is through the gates, and they're at the gates!
Tyrion Lannister: There's another way out; I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses! [the men laugh] Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms! Don't fight for honour, don't fight for glory, don't fight for riches, because you won't get any! This is your city Stannis means to sack, that's your gate he's ramming! If he gets in, it'll be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he'll rape. Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!
Tywin Lannister: The battle is over; We have won!
