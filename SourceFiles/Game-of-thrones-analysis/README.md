# Game-of-thrones-analysis
Analysis of GoT dialogues using NLP techniques. 

The main question I would like to answear is how dialogues relate characters in GoT series, and what we can learn from those relationships and weather or not using a neural network to generate dialogues will be a viable thing to do. 

You can learn more about the motivation for this project in this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/having-fun-with-nlp-and-game-of-thrones-dialogues-21c647b0837f).

## Data

I obtained the raw dialogues from [Genius.com](https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones), these were trancribed by volunteers, so not all
seasons are there and of course you will found some mistakes, but is the best there is. Also I encourage you to participate and transcribe some dialogues yourself, it will be so cool to have all the seasons transcribed for further analysis. 

All the csv files I will use are available [here](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/tree/master/CSV), and you can find how I transform the raw text into a more useful csv in the [Final_Pipeline](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/blob/master/Final_Pipeline.ipynb) notebook.

## File description.

[Final_Pipeline](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/blob/master/Final_Pipeline.ipynb): The whole process from data preparation and analysis to modeling and scoring.

[GoT dialogue generator](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/blob/master/GoT%20dialogue%20generator.ipynb): Using a pre trained model to generate random GoT dialogues. 

[GoT](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/tree/master/GoT): All raw form of chapter scripts obtained from [Genius.com](https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones).

[CSV](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/tree/master/CSV): Three CSV files, if you want to follow all the data cleaning I did you need them. 4 columns they contain: Character, dialogue, season and chapter. The rows vary from file to file but around 14K. 


## Network Graph

I created a network graph using the character interaction I obtained from the dialogues. You can play with it in the following link:

## Dialogue generation.

All the text generation happens in this [notebook](https://github.com/chrismartinezb/Game-of-thrones-analysis/blob/master/GoT%20dialogue%20generator%20(1).ipynb)

I have to give credit to all the volunteers at Genius for transcribing the dialogues as well as to [Paras Chopra](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-new-ideas-for-machine-learning-projects-through-machine-learning-ce3fee50ec2) and [Daniel E. Licht](https://lichtphyz.github.io/) whose work is the base of this project. Apart from that feel free to use the code and files as you wish.
