            "The two-part arc began in the season seven premiere of Game of Thrones, and has taken place in eight episodes. So far three of these three chapters took place around Winterfell: the final chapter of Theon and the battle between Dany's armies at the Wall while the characters on foot guard the castle. The first chapter, \"House of the Undying,\" sees the arrival of the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Catelyn. This chapter also marks the episode's official beginning. Though no-one at the time of the reveal knows the answer, the show already has revealed that the season eight finale will also address the subject when it debuts in the next few weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Catelyn is still alive after her escape from Winterfell and thus is presumably alive. According to one fan, \"she's going to make an interesting return in a few weeks.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "There are also two potential appearances in the premiere of the season, the first taking place after Brienne's speech with Varys the night she left with Tyrion, the second taking place after the events at the Wall where the two armies fight after the death of Tyrion. A full list could be found here.\n",
