."

In that room was a man in a robe of gleaming black velvet. He wore nothing but a high saddle with a lion on it and three lions carved upon it. “We have to do this,” he told the knight. “This is the only thing
you’re worthy of, my lord. Go inside and fetch my sword and bring back the mother. And her daughter, and my son.” His own son, a boy about fifteen, stood in the room
bowing his head. A boy whose only crime was being a boy. The man was wearing the Iron Throne of the Iron
Throne. His boots were black sandals, his robe dagged and crude. He knelt before it in front of the queen and his young
little sister. “It was an honour serving King Robert, your Grace.”
Mace Tyrell, the king’s Hand, was the first to greet Robert Baratheon. “You are my brother Robert, don’t you see?”
Robert Baratheon, Your Grace. Are you well?”
Robert Baratheon, We are. What’s gone on? Are we safe?”
Tyrion Lannister, The war. The war is going on. Are we safe? No. Do we need you? You are young. You’re seventeen. Have you tried to harm us? Have you tried to harm the queen? Are you on the edge of your seat now? Do you want to be high? Do you want to rule the Iron Throne? Do you want to be the King. Do you want to be the Lord of the Iron Mountains? Do you want to be what I told you, Your Grace?”
Robert Baratheon, You are still in my place, Your Grace. Are you in my place? Are you really? I want to be high? I want to be the King. I want to be the Lord of the Iron Mountains. I'm not the King. I'm the King, and I am a Lannister. I'm a Lannister with a golden crown. I’m in your place. Go, and don’t forget it."
Robert Baratheon, How did he do that? I wasn’t in his place. Can I go be King, can I go be Lord of the Iron Mountains? If you could be in my place, you wouldn’t be afraid of the king going in your place.
Tyrion Lannister, A Lannister without kings, the King in the North, the King who wears the direwolf of Stark, a Lannister who has come south with Robb Stark when you were
Robert Baratheon, Yes. To be a Lannister without kings, I couldn’t do it. The King in the North would be a Lannister without kings. With the King in the North in place, I'm not a Lannister without kings
Robert Baratheon, We all know who the King in the North is. That’s why Jon Snow is a Stark. That’s why Robb Stark is a Stark, with the North in his hands. I just need to get outside, to the other side of the Wall. I don’t want to get lost
Tyrion Lannister, You're the King in the North, you could be the King in the North. You were King in the North when I was a Lannister.
Robert Baratheon, I want to go the King in the North, you want to go the King in the North. We both want to go the King in the North.
Tyrion Lannister, I have a sister outside the Wall, an orphan boy. I want to say it, but you don’t want to say it, so you have to leave. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Be a Lannister without kings. Go, and don’t forget it.
Robert Baratheon, You need to go the King in the North. Go, and don’t forget it. You don’t ever really forget. Your sister outside the Wall, she needs someone to protect her, and someone who understands
Robert Baratheon, I love you. It's time for you to go. Goodnight. All of you. Goodbye. And thank you. It doesn’t matter who you are
Robert Baratheon, I love you too, Robert Baratheon

.
But we have nothing to do. What happened to the last time I tried to go out? I went out once but they took both my legs off. What if they take your legs off and put you back in the box? It does seem to me like we could just as well have two of each. We can't have each of their things. But the more of them we leave, the less of ours we have."
Dany: "When we go," said Daenerys Targaryen, who I will call Targ, "when we go, we'll see. If we have things to take, say, you left your things. We have the last one. All the things, but if we have things to take, say, we'll go see. That's what we see. We're not going to see. You, as soon as your mother washes, you'll go see your mother. You're going to go see your mother and meet her. But not now. You might not even see her in your own home. And that's kind of the thing. It's not just going to be the whole army. No. There will be a few, a few."
Jorah Mormont: He was right, that's why we never see your mother, and I think this is very sad. But that will turn out to be only the beginning of something much larger. I bet a hundred dragons you know what the big one is supposed to look like.
Mormont: I do not. I have no memory of it. I was no boy. I think I may be too old, but I was no boy. So this is what it will come to. But I have no memory of any of it. When I'm old and die, my mind will go somewhere else."
Khal Drogo: I cannot leave her at this place without seeing her. When I come back, I must bring her back and give her to the dragon queen. The one who made this place where we are, the one who makes this place for me. This world is the only place I have ever known. And she's the only woman who can save me.
Daenerys Targaryen: Yes, you are right. The world is not the only place. I have to say it right here, I have to say it for good and for bad. You made my mother take me from this place, this world, and we were all just food for a whole army of soldiers. For a whole army of soldiers, I'm still afraid, you're not a soldier. You're not good enough. We've seen a lot more dragons than you can possibly know. And I'm the little girl who had to give up all of her hopes and dreams to be saved by someone who has nothing to offer me but fear. And I don't care what anybody says, I don't care what they say, I only want to live. I wouldn't accept the world. I wouldn't accept everyone. And I don't know how to go on living. You don't know how to go on living. It's like that old saying, you don't know how to go on living, but you do. And it's a long way down the mountain. I didn't come to this world to be saved. I came to this world to live. I told that mountain how to fight. I told this mountain how to live. And when he doesn't answer me, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. So please, help me, just make it stop, please, please…"
Daenerys Targaryen: Tell me what to do, Your Grace. I haven't talked to you in three days. I haven't talked to you in three days. But you're so beautiful. You're very good and I understand that. You're good and you're kind. You just made my mother go away. She didn't want to be saved. She didn't want to be saved. She was just afraid, I swear, but somehow this little girl managed to save us in the end. Even though there are thousands who want her dead. Even though there are thousands who want her dead and want her to go away and they didn't let us. But you killed someone. You killed someone. She didn't need to die and she wouldn't have had to, she would have been with me. She wouldn't have had to go and she would have been with me. She couldn't possibly be with me without you. You just made everyone else choose to be with you. And how could You Save Me? It's something I never thought was possible. The dragons always need saving. Every living thing needs saving. I'm so sorry for you both. I wish we could be together again. I wished you could be together again. Please forgive me. I wish we were together again. Sorry for the wait. Please forgive me. And I

 true you have a nice warm place to keep yourself warm in the night; you'll be the first to admit it. But there are more things than this on the other side of the wall.

joy?" she asked herself.
Bolton’s eyes met Edmure’s. He raised his hands. He was his family’s boy. They are a bunch of fools. You have a good claim to a piece of Bolton blood, don’t you? Of course, Bran is going to defend your bastard. You're going to raise your hands to him."
Mance Rayder looked away. The last thing he wanted was to see his sister's face. She was a stranger to him now. He'd spent his whole life around her, serving his father and his mother. They were as far apart as two men could ever be, yet somehow the boy liked her more than him. And even though it wasn’t true love, he liked what she meant to do to him, what she meant to do to him. And she liked her own father, too. She liked having her arms wrapped around him, her legs around him. She liked having him on top of her, holding him. How could he love her when he didn’t want her? The boy was his brother, he wasn’t the boy he was. Mance was Robb Stark’s friend and the rightful heir to Winterfell. And he didn’t love the girl. He didn’t want her. He didn’t even want her sister. You can't love the wrong thing. Why did you love her, Bran?"
Bolton walked away. Mance Rayder followed. They were both looking for someone to defend their homes when they heard the sound of their own voices, voices they hadn’t heard for days.
Mance Rayder said, “ I always knew you'd be coming. We were close, he told me. You were scared I'd see you again. Didn’t you tell me that was the same as seeing me? I told him you were afraid of your own eyes, you're scared of your own skin. You want to hide. You want to run from the threat, yet you can't. Bran's scared of you because he doesn’t want the eyes. The threat is real, the danger's real, the danger’s real. Even this kid, he knows that he has to be a part of this. You want to take him, I know you do; you want to take this child and you want to breed him, you want to breed him until you see me in his eyes. You don’t want to see, I know. I wanted to see, I wanted to take him, I just wanted to, but my brother told me, don't ever come near me again, or you'll regret it. You have to hide, and you'll see. But I never did. I never did. I never did.",2,4,Brienne Of Tarth,"Mance Rayder,Brienne Of Tarth, You have to hide and you'll see. But I never did. I never did. I never did. "

 We will learn to love this land with all our might. We will learn to be heroes."
Daario Naharis, Let's say we do get rescued. Why do you think I will be the one making fun of this land? It's not like some other places that have given us such blessings. It's got an iron fist in a heart of stone. And people fight for all they know. Maybe this is the land that I love the most of all. Perhaps someday in my lifetime I will visit this place and taste what living in the land is like for a few years. Because this is what the world is like in these lands. All the people, all the cultures, all the stories. And to all of the Dothraki for teaching me these things, in a land that hates women and teaches men to kill their wives and children. And to the Unsullied for teaching me how to be a hero. We are good warriors. We will be better than they are. We will be better than my people. That will be our destiny. But I'm good. The Dothraki are good people. I love Dothraki. I've been Dothraki for many years. I know a lot of Dothraki. And I would never want to see them murdered by some foreign power. The Dothraki are a loyal people. The second I see the Dothraki marching through the streets of the city of Daznak I will be the second one running in their place. Because if I'm not an Unsullied, then what is that? That's not an option. So I will tell the Dothraki to kill themselves from fear, and the Dothraki will see me as an enemy. Then they come in, and I will give them whatever gift they want. They will leave their wives and children in the dirt, with a spear between their legs, and walk out. I will teach them to say my name. And when it is time for me to go, then I will send a raven to the Great Bear to let them know that I will be gone. If we have to live inside the walls I mean to teach them to fight better than they will ever see me. And sometimes I am a little better than they are. I am too good, a real warrior. You see, not everyone is ready to kill themselves to be good. People learn how to be good. And good people die in Daznak's eyes. Who do you think is going to show up for me on my wedding night?".6:30-6:55
Yara Greyjoy," What's that in the air, do you think? Is that the khalasar's best? It's so huge and you're not even afraid to go up against it? They do it all the time. They do it in the waterfalls, they do it around the edge of the world. They do it at the edge of the world.",6:55-7:40
Yara Greyjoy," I'm Yara Greyjoy. We always hear that stories, but when I'm in the Free Cities all that's missing are dragons. I'm proud of the dragons that go with me around the world, but the one I'm proud of is inside my heart. We all know the stories about dragons. A dragon has wings and flies. A dragon has fire and melts ice. A dragon moves through the air and never stops. I don't make those myths for you children. And I have a horn to make your dragons sing to me. I've never worn a horn. I'm not that great. I'm better than you, better than most. And I hate what I'm because my mother has left no mark on me, none in this world. No traces of my mother, no dragons, no dragons, no dragons, no dragons.,7:40-7:56
Yara Greyjoy, All I'm is me.,7:56-8:21
Yara Greyjoy, It feels good. A horn sounds better.,8:21-8:45
Yara Greyjoy, I will not be alone.,8:45-7:29
Yara Greyjoy, The Dothraki will kill and rule in the land of the free.,7:29-7:38
Yara Greyjoy, It doesn't matter.,7:38-7:43
Yara Greyjoy, Dothraki don't give up there.,7:43-8:00
Yara Greyjoy, No. Nobody will. Or ever.,8:00-8:15
Yara Greyjoy, It doesn't matter. You love this land. You love your people.,8:15-8:35
Yara Greyjoy, And you love me. And you love us. And sometimes we're more than just what we look like.,8:35-8:55

I was alone, I was being prepared, and I wanted to make a deal.So we'll make a deal and I'll support a Lannister boy and I'll support a Targaryen boy. And to make it work I need your help. And I demand your pledge, my friend. That you will serve both Lannisters in all that I do.",6,8,Ned Stark,"Petyr Baelish,Ned Stark, We have little interest in the manoeuvres of the battlefield. It's never worked for Jaime. Cersei has no love for Jon Snow.",6,8,Ned Stark,"Petyr Baelish,Ned Stark,  But I have found something in the wilderness that could turn the tide of battle. Jon Snow has it. Slain by a White Walker in the snow. He's bent on your head. He has your two wildlings. He has your cock and balls. He has Jaime Lannister. And there's Lord Rickard Karstark waiting for me in the Red Keep. He has the horns of a swamp goat and a thirst for blood that runs drinking deep. He is as I've ever seen him.,6,8,Robert Karstark,"Petyr Baelish,Robert Karstark, That Karstark is a heretic and a traitor. He swore eternal war to House Karstark but he abandoned his bravest. His army is all but gone. Only the men of Blackwood remain to me. Do you know how deep the valley of the tears runs? The Mother that made us and the Mother that made the Others know we would never stand against the Night's Watch. But here we are. The battle is fought against the sides we're on. We will fight against the clans, we will fight against the lords we're fighting against. No. We are the people, the people of Castle Black. Let us carry on the fight the people have won. As one. Let the people of the Seven Kingdoms help us. Because we choose you to be our Hand. Come and see. We can't change the past. The people of Castle Black will always be our Hand. They'll never be our King. We're changing now. We're in a world that you didn't choose. We're at war and we choose to fight. And the only war we can fight is this one. Do you remember? The Night's Watch is chosen once more this day. Do you remember?"
Robert Baratheon, It's not about choice. It's about destiny.,6,8,Melisandre,"Robert Baratheon,Melisandre, It's not about choice. It's about destiny."
Melisandre," For you it's a question of mutilation and torture. For me it's a question of beauty. Look at my hands. Do you think the world is fair? The mutilation will delight and mad the onlooker. But the beauty court is only the beginning. Beyond the wall lies the vastness of the fantasy world you've created. To carry on the fight the people of Castle Black have won. The women of the North help us. A Northern who would never betray us. Their loyalty is oathbreaking. A Northern who would never betray his swearwords. To serve both of you. To defend the North. That's what these men want. They want the same thing Cersei wanted. They want the throne she never had. They want every crown that's worth having. They wanted back then. They want now. They want all the hills and valleys and low hills and high hills and upper halls and towers. They want it all.",6,8,Robert Baratheon,"Melisandre,Robert Baratheon, It's not about choice.

, we'll call it what it is: a gift from the Queen of Thorns.",5,8,Jaime Lannister,"Bronn Of The Blackwater,Jaime Lannister, You don't know my Daddy, do you? We were at our mother's side all your life. Weighing down the hills together, learning to walk and fight with swords like you're in their place. We never would have gone in Sansa's place if we hadn't decided to forlornly hop from one castle to another. But we're gone now, unliving because of a few hours in the spotlight, and it's affecting how we think. Not thinking, which is what this is. Stress on the mind, stress on the gut. Who has time for this? Time to dwell on the past? The good, the ugly, the lost. That's all there is to say. One day we'll be the envy of the whole Seven Kingdoms. Until that day comes when Aegon Targaryen landed on the shores of Westeros, and women screamed "" They came before us, daughters of dead men. Our breath was warm and sweet. Our hands were dry. Our lips tasted of sour on the side. But you? We grabbed you straightaway. You weren't given to us. But you were given to us. Our hands never stop shaking. This is our home. This is our land. We have sworn a sacred oath to defend it.,5,8,Jaime Lannister,"Bronn Of The Blackwater,Jaime Lannister, You don't know my Daddy, do you? We were at our mother's side all your life. We weighed you from birth. We dipped a knife in your blood and took steps to make sure your bones never touching the ground. We took turns pulling your chest out by the hair and pulling that dress up over your head. We buried you in the crypt until you was five. Then we forged you anew and raised you up on the Iron Throne. But you don't know my Daddy. You don't know steel. So I told you to stay away for your own safety, until you were an older woman. Older and stronger and with a bigger toe. But you were still right, wasn't it? Didn't think so."
Jaime Lannister," You think I disapprove. Why? Because someone has to? One child doesn't need two to steal the show. Or three, or five. You could have been born Casterly Rock. Instead you were born on the Isle of Naarth. But somewhere along the way you morphed into a woman of the Night's Watch. What happens to women on the Isle of Naarth?",5,8,Jaime Lannister,"Jaime Lannister,Jaime Lannister, You think I disapprove. Why? Because someone has to? One child doesn't need two to steal the show.

, but I need you. The entire raiding party needs you. You're the only one ever to have beaten Rhaegar Targaryen in a lightsaber. You're the only one. You are the rightful king. Unless you want to sue me and open your balls with me. Then open them and pour the goop all over my thighs and buttocks and belly button. That's how you defeat a man, girl. That's how you defeat a ruler. You really think you can get the Boltons and the Tigers to fight together against the Lannisters? Unless you're a complete noob, girl. I've killed plenty of raiders into authority. I've seen white walkers and white walkers with white walkers. I've killed stepmothers and fathers and brothers. Even as children. I've seen the red whore vengeful when she's been beaten, and the Boltons decide to pit their dogs against each other. This is the truth. This is the war to win."

The only real conquest that matters is the one that doesn't involve killing your enemy. We are still enemies. In the long run, we're better off without them. So let's conquer. The people of the Seven Kingdoms are exhausted. They've seen them running around with their babies all to show for it. They need a ruler who will help them. I'm aware of what's on the horizon. Donald Trump is the Republican nominee and that will put you in a powerful position to help shape who they are. But I promise you this. No. You will not sway emissaries from the Iron Throne. Never. Donald J. Trump is not a threat. And I'm not running against him. I'm running against all of them. The Unsullied, the Masters of Coin, the Knights of the Vale. Anyone who can't fight back and win without them. They've even elected a woman as the Queen Regent. Who, me?"
High Septon, Not now.,7,3,Cersei Lannister,"High Septon,Cersei Lannister, Not now."
Cersei Lannister," She's a creature of the broken world.Gods be good. I used to be like you. I was very much alike you. Back then, I didn't know how to express love or a lady's bow. But I will. Sometimes. That is how I found the perfect bow. Just when I was about to order Sansa Stark to marry my brother, I heard a voice behind me. And it was my brother. He stood up tall enough with my help.
